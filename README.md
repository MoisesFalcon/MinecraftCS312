# MinecraftCS312
# Setup
- First you'll need the correct tools to create the minecraft server. The tools needed are Terraform and AWS CLI
- I did this on windows so the easiest way to install Windows is through Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/)
- choco install Terraform
- To install AWS CLI follow the Amazon documentation for Windows (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
# Terraform
- Now we will create a terraform file called maincraft.tf (Thank you, I'll be here all night)
- Copy the maincraft.tf file from the Git Repo but change a few things
